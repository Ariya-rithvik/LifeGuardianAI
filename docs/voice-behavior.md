# Voice Interaction Behavior

The system uses calm, human-like voice interaction to avoid panic.

## Tier 1 – Gentle Check-in
"Hello, I noticed you may have fallen. Are you okay? Please respond if you can."

## Tier 2 – Concerned Warning

## Tier 3 – Emergency Alert
"I haven't heard from you. I'm contacting your emergency contacts now."

## Keywords That Trigger Immediate Emergency
